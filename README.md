# Welcome to the Team generator!

## This application was a test of my test writing, modal building and referencing, and data passing for functions.

### You will be able to add Managers, Engineers, and Interns to an html file that is updated with the new information upon every finished in console addition.

My biggest struggles with this application passing data, building the cards, and allowing the in console functionality to repeat upon completion.
